Carol S. Dweck is a psychologist who studies the relationship between mindset and motivation. She measured students on an axis of how they view their own intelligence. Some students view intelligence as malleable, and can be improved through work. Others view it as fixed and cannot change over time. 

Students who view their own ability or intelligence as malleable, when faced with challenges, will often respond by working harder. On the other hand, students that view their ability or intelligence as fixed, will give up perhaps thinking that they will not be smart enough to rise to that challenge.

She points to one way of changing the mindset of children so they can respond to difficult challenges which may result in immediate negative feedback. She points to a school in Chicago that gives scores of "Not Yet" instead of failing grades. This encourages students to think of themselves as continually improving. 

There are many studies that point to the idea that changing mindset in students will result in increased effort, and increased performance.

In summary, if you fail at a challenge, and think "Not Yet," you will have the motivation to improve yourself for the next time you face the challenge.

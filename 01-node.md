1. How can you describe Node.js in a non-technical way?

Node.js is software that can run javascript programs that programmers write. 
Other software is required to run Java, C# or, Scratch. Node.js is for JavaScript.
In the past, JavaScript was slow. Most people only used JavaScript to "script" or program things in the browswer, such as animations, or reactions to clicks on a page.
Over the years Google and other companies invested in making JavaScript fast. It became so fast, programers wanted to use it for more general needs, such as on servers or in databases.
Node was created to extract the work Google and other companies did and make it easy for programers to run it on their own computer without a browser, or on a server.

2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

Node.js can run JavaScript. That is pretty much what it does. So we call it a runtime.

3. What is Node used for?

Node.js is used for servers, databases, commandline scripts, and development tools.

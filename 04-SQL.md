[SQL vs NOSQL](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/)

For data with complex relations, SQL will be a better fit.

For data that is very heirarchical, NoSql would work since everything will nest easily.

SQL databases scale as you add more RAM and power. NoSQL databases can scale by adding more machines.

One way to have data relate is the one-to-many relation. This is down with a foreign key and a join.

The primary key is used to fetch a table. The foreign key is used to relate a table to another table.

# AWS S3 and Lambda functions

S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. It is a service to store data such as pictures, text, or other binary files. It is a very cost effective way of storing and sharing data in the cloud. It also has an extensive policy system to allow or deny access to different users or agents. It consists of a collection of buckets in which to put objects. Each object has a key. The object is accessed by the key. The keys can by organized by folders, but the folder name is still part of the key. 

## Lambda functions

Lambda functions are small programs that can be put into the AWS infrastructure and set up to run on given triggers. One trigger can be whenever a file is uploaded or changed in an S3 bucket. They can also be triggered whenever a certain url is accessed. These are only two of the many examples of possible uses of Lambda functions.

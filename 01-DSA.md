# Some thoughts on Data Structures

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

When choosing a structure it's best to consider how you want to put and get information in and out of it. Then, consider how long it takes to do the put and get operations. This will effect the overall running time of the algorithm.


2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

One way to check to see you wont run forever is to make sure your number, or the size of the operating space is decreasing. As long as it is decrementing by 1 or is halving each step, you can be sure that it eventually will come to a stop.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to review material on how to implement tree algorithms like insert and delete. There can be a lot os steps and it is easy to forget or get things wrong. There are many ways to insert into different types of trees so that the height is optimized. These can get tricky but it is important to know how to do at least some of them.
I also want ro review the basic graph algorithms. Many are sort, but very subtle. It's not easy to follow unless you really have a long think about what they are doing conceptually. It takes a lot of concentration and that takes time. But its worthwile if you have the time to spend it there.
